      <description>Alright! There is a lot to cover here, so let&amp;rsquo;s get started.
The DragonSpark Framework What has brought me to this current status? Well, it all started when I had a framework that I was working on known as The DragonSpark Framework. It had active development until late 2016. At this time I took interest in assisting in another repository, the ExtendedXmlSerializer v2.
ExtendedXmlSerializer v2 Building ExtendedXmlSerializer was my first foray into open source software collaboration, and I learned a lot from it.</description>

      <description>Hello world! What is happenin&amp;rsquo;?!
I&amp;rsquo;m very happy to introduce my latest project and idea:
The DragonSpark Blog, Dawg! Written with Hugo and utilizing the Bilberry Theme.
Well, to be sure, the blog isn&amp;rsquo;t the idea, but it will be used to tell you about it in the next few rounds (and probably more ðŸ˜‡) of development.
So What&amp;rsquo;s Up? I&amp;rsquo;ve had what you can say is an epiphany of sorts with my general direction in life.</description>
