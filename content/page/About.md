Welcome to The DragonSpark Blog, Dawg!  

I am your host, Michael DeMond -- aka Mike-EEE, or perhaps for the purposes of this project, Mike-EEEangelo.  With a little luck, I hope to have the chance to explain why at some point. üòÅ

This is a little place that I have carved out in the interwebs for my latest project, The DragonSpark Experiment.  With this blog, I hope to have a resource that I can utilize to share status updates regarding my new crazy idea, along with any other quick thoughts or dissertations that I wish to disperse to the public.

For more information and to dive into the details, check out [my introductory Hello World article](/2019/11/hello-world/).
