Hello world!  What is happenin'?!

I'm very happy to introduce my latest project and idea:

The DragonSpark Blog, Dawg!  Written with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and utilizing the [Bilberry Theme](https://github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme).

Well, to be sure, the blog isn't the idea, but it will be used to tell you about it in the next few rounds (and probably more üòá) of development.

### So What's Up?

I've had what you can say is an epiphany of sorts with my general direction in life.  It wasn't sudden, though.  It took a lot of work and contemplation to get here.

In fact, you could say that I have been in a creative funk for a bit now, and I am embarrassed to say for how long.  In an effort to jumpstart my creativity, I fell back on an old faithful: website development.  That has led to me utilizing Hugo and producing this here blog to communicate my life to you.

PRETTY COOL HUH. üòÅ

### What's the Blog, Dawg?

Interestingly enough, I have been thinking about putting together my own blog for a while now, but I couldn't quite put my finger on how I wanted to do it.  As I said there has been a lot of contemplation on my part and I landed on some "pillars of interest" in my world.  

My thought was to make a blog where each post could be divided into one of the following categories:

- Business
- Art
- Technology
- Life (philosophy)
- Etc. (all the rest/remainder)

There have been so many times I have wanted to post something or a quick thought outside of 280 characters allotted on Twitter.  Plus, Twitter is so noisy.  A blog is basically a filtered view of important thoughts provided by a person or brand.  I find Twitter is where the commentary/feedback occurs.

In any case, I finally was able to connect everything together when brainstorming my new idea and it culminated into the production of this blog.

### Expectations of Schedule/Content

All that said, I am not entirely sure how often I will actually use this sucker.  I wanted primarily to make it to get myself some personal development and creative momentum, which I feel I have accomplished.

But also, I now have a medium to utilize if I so wish.  So, we'll see how it pans out.  I am not a big fan of setting expectations [only to have them unfulfilled down the line](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/our-emotional-footprint/201602/man-plans-and-god-laughs).

The other consideration is that if I am spending time blogging, I am not developing my latest idea, The DragonSpark Experiment.

### What is The DragonSpark Experiment?

Hey, glad you asked. üòÜ  It is an idea that I put together that feels legitimate.  Or at least, feels legitimate enough to pursue it.  It has a business model and everything, and the more I think about it, the more excited I get about it, so it's been fun and is the primary motivating factor to establish this blog.

Getting back to not setting expectations, I do not like talking about details before developing them as I feel that jinxes things a bit.  However, I will say that this idea squarely fulfills the Business, Art, & Technology pillars listed above.  As far as Life, well, perhaps that will make itself known as time progresses.

### Welcome Aboard, Dawg!

So, there you have it!  I am aiming to keep this article short and sweet.  Thank you for any interest you have in this sucker, and I welcome you aboard to The DragonSpark Blog, Dawg!
